# LMC Utils

Utilities to reason about automata and formal languages. Most algorithms implemented, are realizations of same mentioned in the textbook.

## Utilities offered

### Finite automata

- Conversion from NFA to equivalent regular expression.
- Checking equivalence of regular expressions.

### Pushdown automata

- Normalizing CFG to equivalent CNF.
- Checking membership of string in CFG.
- Conversion from PDA to equivalent CFG.
- Checking (in)equivalence of CFG.
